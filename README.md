# CV Papers Reading Notes
Reading notes for both classical and SOTA papers in computer vision.
## Preconditions
1. It is recommended to learn Stanford cs231n to gain some basics in computer vision, after which you may find it easier to read these papers.
2. Since github editor don't support latex, please use the chrome extension [**MathJax Plugin for Github**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima) so that you can see the formula in th notes. (If MathJax Plugin for Github can't be installed, try [**MathJax 3 Plugin for Github**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-3-plugin-for-gith/peoghobgdhejhcmgoppjpjcidngdfkod/related))
