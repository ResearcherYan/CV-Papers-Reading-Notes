# CV Papers Reading Notes
Reading notes for both classical and SOTA papers in computer vision.
## Preconditions
1. It is recommended to learn Stanford cs231n to gain some basics in computer vision, after which you may find it easier to read these papers.
2. Since github editor don't support latex, please use the chrome extension [**MathJax Plugin for Github**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-plugin-for-github/ioemnmodlmafdkllaclgeombjnmnbima) so that you can see the latex-styled formula in the notes. (If MathJax Plugin for Github can't be installed, try [**MathJax 3 Plugin for Github**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mathjax-3-plugin-for-gith/peoghobgdhejhcmgoppjpjcidngdfkod/related)).

[**IMPORTANT UPDATE**]<br>
On May 19 2022, github published a [changelog](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-05-19-render-mathematical-expressions-in-markdown/) which claimed to support built-in LaTeX with the help of MathJax. However the built-in LaTeX functions seemed to be really unstable, which triggered a distorted display quiet frequently. Tried plenty of chrome extensions to fix that bug. Yet no progress made.<br>
So in order to view the LaTeX formulations with the best compatibility, just **download the markdown files to your local computer and open it with vscode** (Make sure you've installed the **Markdown Preview Github Styling** vscode extension).
